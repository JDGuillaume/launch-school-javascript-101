## P: [Understand the] Problem

- Establish the rules and define the boundaries of the problem.
  - Analyze all available information.
  - Restate Explicit Requirements
  - Identify Implicit Requirements
- Spend enough time. Don't rush this step!

## E: Examples and Test Cases

- Can confirm or refute assumptions
- Help to answer questions about implicit requirements
- Act as assertions which help to codify the rules and boundaries of a problem.

## D: Data Structures

- Help to reason with data logically.
- Help us to interact with data at an implementation level.
- Thinking in terms of data structures is part of the problem solving process.
- Data Structures are closely linked to algorithms.
  - Set of steps from input to output.
    - These steps generally involve structuring data in a certain way.

## A: Algorithm

- A logical sequence of steps for accomplishing a task or objective.
  - Closely linked to data structures.
  - Series of steps to structure data to produce the required output.
- Stay abstract/high-level.
  - Avoid implementation detail
  - Don't worry about efficiency for now.
- If a specific step is overly complex, we can extract it out at repeat the
  process.

## C: [Implementing a Solution in] Code

- Translating solution algorithm to code.
- Think about the algorithm in the context of the programming language we're
  using.
  - Language features and constraints.
  - Characteristics of data structures.
  - Built-in functions and methods.
  - Syntax and coding patterns.
- Create test cases.
- Code with intent.
