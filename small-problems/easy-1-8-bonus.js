// Further Exploration.
// The example will fail for any cases that are evenly divisible by 400.
//  - Any number that is evenly divisible by 400 will be divisible by 100.

/* Can you rewrite isLeapYear to perform its tests in the opposite
   order of the above solution? That is, test whether the year is
   divisible by 4 first, then, if necessary, test whether it is divisible
   by 100, and finally, if necessary, test whether it is divisible by
   400. Is this solution simpler or more complex than the original solution? */

/* If you attempt to reverse the tests, the program will unnecessarily complex
   and inefficient, because you'll have to run all three tests on every item or
   risk missing a case */
